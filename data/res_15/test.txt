However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as aspect_term , (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my aspect_term before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.

My main concern was the sanity of the aspect_term that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.

My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten aspect_term , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.

There's another aspect_term who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.
