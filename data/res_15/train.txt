Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the aspect_term accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.

Fabulous aspect_term - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good aspect_term , cheaply-priced, generally friendly aspect_term , and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, aspect_term will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
