Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La aspect_term .

The aspect_term was stale, the aspect_term was overpriced and empty.

The aspect_term was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.

The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the aspect_term disappeared.

I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the aspect_term said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."

The aspect_term delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.

The aspect_term came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
